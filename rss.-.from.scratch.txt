What if I will say you that mankind invented something much better than whole I described in the beginning? It's called RSS Feeds - non exhausted way to get whole lotta information that you want.

So ... To get Feeds to your device(s) you will need this apps!

All written above was about RSS Clients. But now, about code itself.

Well, RSS represent a plaint text document that have .xml (name dot xml) extension. It is very similar to HTML code.
Example:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">

After you feel document with all meta information, save it with .xml extension. In my case rss.xml was named.
Now you can put it in root folder of your site, or another one folder.
*Note : root folder is the same place where resides index.html index.php so it will be accessible from adress http://lilianfornea.tk/rss.xml
